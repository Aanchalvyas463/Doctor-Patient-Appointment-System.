# Doctor-Patient-Appointment-System.
SQL case-based assignment for a Doctor-Patient Appointment System. This scenario involves  managing data related to doctors, patients, appointments, specialties, and hospital departments. I'll  provide the database schema followed by 10 SQL queries based on the system's requirements. 


# Case Study: Doctor-Patient Appointment System 
## Background: 
You are a database analyst for a healthcare system managing doctor-patient appointments. You are 
tasked with generating reports based on appointment data, doctor details, patient information, and 
payments. 

# SQL Queries for the Case Study 

1. Find the Total Number of Appointments for Each Doctor 
2. List All Patients Who Have an Appointment with a Specific Doctor (e.g., Dr. John Smith) 
3. Find the Number of Appointments Scheduled in a Specific Department 
4. Find the Most Popular Specialty Based on Number of Appointments 
5. Get the Total Payment Amount for All Completed Appointments 
6. Find the Number of Patients Seen by Each Doctor 
7. List All Patients Who Have Missed Their Appointments (Status 'Cancelled') 
8. Find the Total Number of Appointments for Each Status (Scheduled, Completed, Cancelled) 
9. Get the Average Payment Amount for Completed Appointments 
10. Find the Doctor with the Highest Number of Appointments

# Task Summary: 
This SQL case study involves the Doctor-Patient Appointment System, focusing on querying and 
analyzing data related to doctors, patients, appointments, specialties, departments, and payments. 

# The queries provide insights into: 

1. Doctor workload and appointments: Find how many appointments each doctor has or the 
number of patients seen. 
2. Department and specialty analysis: Understand the appointment distribution by department 
or specialty. 
3. Patient behavior: Track missed appointments, total payments, and payments per 
appointment status. 
4. Financial analysis: Calculate total payments for completed appointments and average 
payment amounts.

# Key SQL concepts used: 

• JOIN (to combine data from multiple tables) 
• GROUP BY (to group data based on specific columns like doctor, department, or status) 
• COUNT() and SUM() (to calculate totals) 
• ORDER BY (to rank or sort data based on specific metrics) 
• AVG() (to calculate average payment amounts)
